## Whoami üë§
I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with 4 years of experience in both frontend and backend technologies. Programming runs in my blood, as I started studying technology at the age of 14 when I developed a Java and MySQL system for my aunt's pizzeria. Since then, I have worked on various projects, including giving Arduino workshops in college, developing websites for renowned brands like Dior and Nivea, and leading SaaS projects.

## Experience
I have been working professionally as a programmer since early 2019, gaining extensive experience in PHP (Laravel, Lumen, CakePHP) and JavaScript (NestJS, NextJS, FlowJS). I have also been involved in the development of a search system for a major retail store using ElasticSearch.

## Current Studies
Currently, I am expanding my skillset by studying ExpoJS and React Native for app development. I am excited to explore the possibilities of creating mobile applications using these technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the field.
